# PyTorch Learning Projects

A collection of projects created to learn and experiment with PyTorch for deep learning.

## Project List

- **CAT vs Fish Classifier**  
    SImple Classifier Neural NEtwork 
    Accuracy: 76.85%
    Validation Loss: 0.23

## How It Is Made

- Implemented using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- Data preprocessing with `torchvision`(As of now)
- Models built with neural network modules (`nn.Module`)
- Training and evaluation scripts using standard PyTorch workflows
- Results tracked for accuracy and validation loss
